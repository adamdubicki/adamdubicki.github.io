  <h1>Hi there! My name is Adam Dubicki.</h1>

    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <hr />
    <p>
      I'm a full-stack dev living in beautiful Victoria, BC. I've been building
      for the web since finishing my CS degree at UVic back in 2017. These days,
      I spend most of my building backends with Spring Boot, NestJS, and
      Node.js, but I'm always down to talk shop about new frameworks or clean
      code. When I'm not staring at a terminal, I'm usually trying to tire
      myself out. In the summer, that means long distance or hiking up Mt.
      Finlayson. When it's too cold for the trails, you'll find me staying warm
      inside with a great book or a board game.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am self-taught in scratchboard art. I mostly draw animals. My designs
      can be purchased on <a
